Pacmite Genetic Algorithm Instructions

Files:

GA.py is the main Genetic Algorithm File. The main function is in here.

Battles.py contains functions that do battles and get scores/sort populations based on these scores.

Writers.py has a bunch of file writing/reading functions. Functions that read and update champions are in here. 

Rest of the files were in the original file, were not modified. 

HOW TO RUN:
Go into the Python file and run GA.py with python3
It will automatically create a champions.txt file and update it after each iteration.
It will also output the current best gene after each iteration of the main function.
